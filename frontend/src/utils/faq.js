        question: "How does the room matching process work?",
        answer:
          "Our algorithm matches rooms based on mutual preferences. When you list your room, you specify what you're looking for in a new room.

        question: "What happens when I find a room I'm interested in?",
        answer:
          "When you find a room you're interested in, you can send a swap request to the other student. They'll receive a notification and can review your room details. If they accept, you'll both receive contact information to coordinate the exchange. If they decline, you'll be notified and can continue looking for other matches.",

        id: "match3",
        question:
          "Can I swap with someone who doesn't have the exact room I want?",
        answer:
          "Yes, you can adjust your preferences at any time. While our system aims to find the closest matches to your stated preferences, you might find rooms that are slightly different but still appealing. You can always contact the other student to discuss the details before finalizing the swap.",
      },
      {
        id: "match4",
        question: "Is there a limit to how many swap requests I can send?",
        answer:
          "You can have up to 5 active swap requests at any given time. This limit helps ensure that all requests are genuine and prevents system overload. Once a request is accepted or declined, it no longer counts toward your limit.",

    process: [
      {
        id: "proc1",
        question: "How do I complete a room swap once both parties agree?",
        answer:
          "After both parties agree to a swap, you should: 1) Contact your hostel administration to inform them about the planned exchange, 2) Complete any paperwork required by your institution, 3) Arrange a mutually convenient time for the physical exchange, 4) Update your address details on SwapStay once the swap is complete. Our system will guide you through each step of the process.",

        id: "proc2",
        question: "Do I need administration approval for swapping rooms?",
        answer:
          "Yes, most institutions require administrative approval for room exchanges.

We recommend checking your institution's specific policies and including the administration in the final stages of your swap.",

        id: "proc3",
        question: "What if I change my mind after agreeing to a swap?",
        answer:
          "We encourage all users to honor their commitments. However, if circumstances change and you must cancel an agreed swap, you should immediately notify the other party through our messaging system. Frequent cancellations may affect your user rating and ability to use the platform in the future.",
      },
      {
        id: "proc4",
        question: "How long does the entire swapping process usually take?",
        answer:
          "The timeline varies depending on multiple factors, including how quickly you find a match and how efficiently your institution processes the paperwork. On average, from listing to completing a swap takes about 1-3 weeks. Planning ahead, especially before the start of a new semester, is recommended.",
